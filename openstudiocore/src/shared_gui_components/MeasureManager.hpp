/***
* MeasureManager provides a single interface for finding measures on the user's computer in a variety of places.  
*
* It also manages checking if a newer version of a given measure is available on the user's computer and updating
* a SimpleProject to use the updated measure.  Measures directories are searched in the following order 
* 1) pat application measures, 2) my measures, 3) bcl measures.  This supports the following use cases:
*
* A user has started a measure in their my measures directory, then uploaded to BCL, then downloaded that measure then
* a measure with the same uid will exist in both my measures and the bcl measures.  The my measures version is prefered.
* 
* A user has downloaded a measure from the bcl to their local bcl and manually copied the directory to my measures.  
* This use case is not supported but in this case the my measures version is preferred.
*
* A user has manually downloaded a measure from the bcl to their my measures directory as well as downloaded it to their local bcl.  
* In this case the my measures version is preferred.
*
* A user has downloaded a copy of a built in measure from the bcl to their local bcl.  
* In this case the built in version is preferred.
* 
* A user has manually downloaded a copy of a built in measure from the bcl to their my measures directory.  
* In this case the built in version is preferred.
*
* A user has downloaded a copy of a built in measure from the bcl to their local bcl then duplicated it to my measures.  
* In this case there is no uuid conflict.
* 
* A user has manually downloaded a copy of a built in measure from the bcl to their my measures directory then duplicated it to my measures.  
* In this case there is no uuid conflict.
*
* A user has manually copies a measure in their my measures directory to their my measures directory.  
* In this case only one of the measures is displayed.
