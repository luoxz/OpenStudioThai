  /** Constructor. Required argument objectiveToMinimizeFirst is the index of the objective 
   *  function (0 or 1) for which the minimum curve will be constructed. This means that the 
   *  SequentialSearch algorithm will first work towards locating the point that minimizes this
   *  objective function, in the direction of also minimizing the other objective function. After
   *  achieving this minimum point, objectiveToMinimizeFirst will be allowed to increase, while
   *  the other objective function continues to be driven towards its minimum. The final 
   *  MinimumCurve(objectiveToMinimizeFirst) will contain the convex hull of the overall 
   *  ParetoFront; the values of objectiveToMinimizeFirst will first decrease, then increase; and 
   *  the other objective function will monotonically decrease. 
   *
   *  In NREL analyses, objectiveToMinimizeFirst typically refers to an economic objective, and 
   *  the other objective function is typically an energy metric. In this way the final curve 
   *  traces out minimum cost designs for each level of energy use that improves on the baseline
   *  (existing building or code minimum). */
